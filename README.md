### 📂 Featured Cybersecurity Projects: [View Projects] | (https://github.com/ecb0523/Cybersecurity-Portfolio)

#### 🐍 Automation & Data Security
* **[Python Allow-List Algorithm]:** Developed a Python script to automate the management of restricted IP addresses. The algorithm parses an external text file, identifies unauthorized IPs using a loop, and updates the "allow list" dynamically.
* **[SQL Security Filtering]:** Investigated potential security incidents by writing complex SQL queries (AND, OR, NOT, LIKE) to filter failed login attempts after hours and track suspicious employee machine activity.
* **[Linux File Permissions Audit]:** Conducted a deep dive into Linux filesystem security, managing user/group/other permissions (chmod) and securing hidden files to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege.

#### 🕵️ Incident Response & Threat Analysis
* **[Network Traffic Analysis (SYN Flood)]:** Analyzed packet captures using **tcpdump** to identify a SYN Flood DoS attack. Documented the TCP three-way handshake failure and recommended firewall rate-limiting rules.
* **[Phishing & Ransomware Response]:** Documented a multi-stage response to a healthcare ransomware incident. Analyzed malicious file hashes via **VirusTotal** and followed SOC playbooks to escalate and remediate the threat.
* **[Brute Force Investigation]:** Investigated an HTTP brute-force attack on a web server. Analyzed how the attacker bypassed weak passwords to inject malicious JavaScript and recommended IAM hardening.

#### 📋 Risk Management & Compliance
* **[Botium Toys Security Audit]:** Performed a comprehensive risk assessment and compliance audit for an e-commerce company, aligning their security posture with **PCI DSS**, **GDPR**, and **SOC type 2** standards.
* **[NIST Risk Register & Assessment]:** Developed a professional risk register for a financial institution, calculating risk priority scores based on likelihood and severity for threats like Business Email Compromise (BEC).
* **[Vulnerability Assessment Report]:** Conducted a systematic review of a MySQL database server, identifying high-risk exfiltration paths and implementing a remediation strategy involving TLS encryption and MFA.

### 📊 Security Visualizations
* **[Phishing Click-Rate Dashboard]:** Created visual data representations of phishing susceptibility across different organizational departments (HR, Media, Global Security) to drive targeted security awareness training.
